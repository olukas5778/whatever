      <h3> This was an opinion piece I wrote for "The Breeze" my spring semester of junior year. I've always been intrigued by the growth of technology and how it genuinely runs our lives. I had had a discussion in one of my classes about the ethics behind Google and peoples' right to privacy. After this discussion, I decided to do more research on this topic and found that Google has various methods for tracking users' search history and profiting from ad revenue with no consent. This isn't really a secret to many, but I wanted to write about it to draw more attention to the topics and maybe encourage students at JMU to utilize other products.  <a href="https://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/opinion-google-is-not-all-the-hype/article_63c47416-d3d5-11ed-9387-5740af4b394b.html"> Google is not all the hype. </a> </h3>

      <h3> This was another opinion piece I wrote my spring semester of junior year about the rise of AI. AI and ChatGpt have been a popular conversation topic recently which I thought would make it a good piece to write about in the newspaper. It is also a controversial topic with vastly different opinions, which is always good for opinion pieces. Overall, I wrote about how people shouldn't resist this change because regardless of what people think, it's going to persist and grow. Rather, people should work on utilizing it for the good and learn how to maintain its power. <a href="https://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/opinion-the-growth-of-ai-is-inevitable-and-people-should-accept-it/article_8381431c-c8c5-11ed-b750-ff1b14cb3b85.html"> The Growth of AI. </a></h3>

      <h3> This was an opinion piece I wrote my fall semester of junior year. This article was awarded the most popular opinion piece of the year. I wrote about the U.S. mentality of climbing up the corporate ladder and how in my opinion it's damaging to peoples' quality of life. Being a college student, it's scary having this mentality pushed on us all of the time. I do believe it's important to work hard, but trying to be the best constantly will just lead to burn out and overall dissatisfaction. <a href="https://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/opinion-climbing-up-the-corporate-ladder-is-detrimental-to-life-satisfaction/article_64bdadec-a7c5-11ed-aa48-27349328096a.html"> Corporate Ladder.</a>  </h3>
